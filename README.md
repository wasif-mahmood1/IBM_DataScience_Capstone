# IBM Data Science Capstone

## Overview

The **IBM Data Science Capstone Project** provides you with the opportunity to apply the skills you've learned throughout the program to a real-world data science problem. The final task of this project is to create a compelling and easy-to-understand presentation based on the outcomes of all the tasks completed in the previous modules and labs. Your presentation will serve as a summary of your data science journey, showcasing your ability to collect, analyze, and derive insights from data.

### Key Components:

- **Presentation**: The core task is to develop a PowerPoint presentation that synthesizes your entire data science journey throughout the project.
- **Storytelling**: Your presentation should not just be a technical rundown, but a story that’s engaging and informative to your audience.
  
### Presentation Details:

- **PowerPoint Template**: A PowerPoint template has been provided to help you get started. You are free to customize and add additional slides, charts, or tables as necessary to effectively tell your story.
- **Final Assessment**: The presentation will be peer-reviewed. There are **40 points** available for this final assignment, and you will be graded by your fellow peers who are also completing this project.
